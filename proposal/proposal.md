# Problem
The problem we are investigating is that of conducting search-and-rescue operations in the wake of disaster in such a way that the most victims possible can be rescued while the risk to the rescue team is minimized. The authors are seeking to develop a scene recognition model that will take data from real-time computer vision to help locate survivors in disaster zones. Our model can then be deployed on an autonomous device. This would lessen the strain on human rescuers by improving the efficiency of locating possible survivors in disaster areas where visibility is low and other risk factors are prevalent. By developing new autonomous ways to traverse hazardous and volatile disaster sites, this project can improve search efficiency by directing efforts more specifically as well as lessen the risk to people participating in the search. 

# Contextual Work
The application of machine learning to disaster management, mitigation, and prediction is well documented and prolific. This includes predicting disasters before they occur, rapidly managing disasters as they occur [2], and handling disasters after the fact [1]. With the modern advent of this technology, the capability to prepare for and process calamitous events has been greatly aided, and will continue to prove useful now and into the future [3]. 

# Data
The project data is being taken from Googleâ€™s Open Images Version 6 dataset. We plan to use a subset of the entire dataset because the original size is 1.7 million images. A dataset like this would make model training very time consuming. This means that running experiments to optimize model hyperparameters and test multiple models would be infeasible. The Open Images dataset is accessible using the FiftyOne tool, which allows a user to choose the data that they download. Data can be downloaded by: class, types of annotations, amount of data, and which split to download.

# Methodology
Our model will employ a convolutional neural network architected for object detection that is fed images of people and their specific parts (arms, legs, hands, etc.) in order to train it to identify any visible part amidst rubble and other obstacles.

# Evaluation
We plan to use multiple different evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of our model. The first is Intersection over Union (IoU), which evaluates the overlap between the ground truth and the predicted bounding box. A perfect overlap is represented by an IOU score of 1, and no overlap gives an IoU score of 0. Using IoU, we can create a threshold for deciding whether the model made a correct prediction or not [4]. This will allow us to use additional metrics such as precision and recall to determine the types of errors our model is making. In our problem, Type II error is far more dangerous than Type I error. A Type II error would cause our model to predict that there is no one in the video frame, despite there actually being someone. This could cause that person to not be saved by the machine. Precision and Recall could be extended to mean average precision (mAP), which would allow us to map the average precision across the different classes using the area under the curve for Precision and Recall.
