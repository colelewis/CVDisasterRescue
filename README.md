## Source
All working code and is found in the `src` folder.

## Build Notes
Present here in the inventory is a folder named `/venv` which contains the Python "virtual environment" that bundles all the dependencies needed for the program. While normally the dependencies would be exported to a flat file which a user could then install, certain dependencies such as pseyepy (for use with the PlayStation Eye) require extra setup and effort to install.

To use the `venv` folder, make your current directory the same as the `venv` folder, but not inside of it. Then, you'll enter `source venv/bin/activate` at which point your terminal should show `(venv)` at the beginning of your prompt.
